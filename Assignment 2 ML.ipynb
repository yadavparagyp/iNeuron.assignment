    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to Ride a Bicycle: This involves acquiring the physical skills necessary for balance, coordination, and control through practice and repetition.\n",

    "Generalization is the ability of a machine learning model to perform well on new, unseen data that was not part of the training dataset. It is a crucial aspect of the machine learning process because it ensures that the model can apply what it has learned to real-world situations and not just memorize the training data. A model with good generalization can effectively handle variability and noise in the data."
