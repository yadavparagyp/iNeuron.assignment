    "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without using explicit instructions. Instead, these systems rely on patterns and inference derived from data to improve their performance over time."

    "Natural Language Processing (NLP): Tasks like sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbots benefit greatly from machine learning models.\n",
    "Predictive Analytics: Machine learning is used in financial markets for stock price prediction, in healthcare for predicting disease outbreaks, and in various industries for demand forecasting.\n",

    "A labelled training set is a dataset that includes both the input data and the corresponding output or label. For example, in a dataset for image classification, the input would be images, and the labels would be the categories those images belong to (e.g., \"cat,\" \"dog\"). During training, a machine learning algorithm uses this labelled data to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs, which it can then use to make predictions on new, unseen data."

This allows the model to adapt to new data on-the-fly, making it suitable for applications where data arrives continuously, such as stock price prediction or real-time recommendation systems."

    "Out-of-core learning refers to training machine learning algorithms on datasets that are too large to fit into a computer's main memory (RAM). It uses external memory, such as disk storage, and processes data in mini-batches. In contrast, core learning involves training on datasets that fit entirely in memory."

    "Hyperparameters: These are external configurations set by the practitioner before training begins. They are not learned from the data but rather set to control the learning process, such as the learning rate, the number of trees in a random forest, or the number of clusters in K-means."
