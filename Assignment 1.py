#3. Describe three different data types.

# List- Lists are used to store multiple element in a single variable. Example- List = ["ineuron","datascience",8]
#tuple- Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.here, elements are indexed. Example - tuple = ("ineuron", "data science")
#Dictonary- Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.Items are changeable and ordered. Example- Dict = {"company":"ineuron", "employee":"xyz"}

#4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

#Expression is made up of variable, operators and functions.For example- (x = 2 y = 3 ; x+y)where x & y are variables, 2 and 3 are int values and + is an mathematical operators.
#the expression evaluates down to a single or specific outcome.

#5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between and expression and a statement?

#The assignment statement like spam  = 10 represent command or value to assign whereas exprssion contains variable, operators and function.

#8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

#Whereas egg is not any datatype.

#9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

#int() = integer
#float() = floting point number
#str()  = string

#10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix?
